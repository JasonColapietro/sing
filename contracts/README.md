# Cross-surface contracts

Suede's vocal domain is implemented four times: this repo's TypeScript, the
companion web app in `Suede-AI/suede-voice`, the SwiftUI app, and the Android
app. Until now the numbers moved between them by hand, copied out of a handoff
document into a second language. That is silent drift. Nothing fails; the two
apps just start scoring the same performance differently, and nobody finds out
until a singer notices.

A contract here is the reference surface's numbers, serialized, so the other
surfaces can assert against them instead of re-typing them.

## practice-parity

`practice-parity.json` holds the web's practice and song-scoring reference:
pitch tolerance, tempo bounds and the auto-tempo thresholds, transpose clamp,
difficulty cuts, band ladder, judgment floors and points, the score multiplier
rungs, guide-pass percentages, the mastery score, and the XP and level ladder.

**It is generated, not written.** `practice-parity.ts` imports the constants
from the modules the app actually runs on and serializes them.
`practice-parity.test.ts` fails when the committed JSON and the live constants
disagree, which is what stops the file going stale. Change `TEMPO_STEP` in
`components/songs/lib.ts` and the suite goes red until the contract is
regenerated.

Regenerate after any reference constant changes:

```bash
CONTRACT_WRITE=1 npx vitest run contracts/practice-parity.test.ts
```

Then commit the JSON alongside the change, so the native repos see the new
number as a diff rather than never hearing about it.

### Consuming it from a native repo

`Suede-AI/suede-voice` vendors a byte-identical copy at its own
`contracts/practice-parity.json` and asserts its Swift constants against it, so
a divergence fails a test on whichever side moved. Re-sync that copy with:

```bash
curl -fsSL -H "Authorization: token $(gh auth token)" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/JasonColapietro/sing/contents/contracts/practice-parity.json \
  -o contracts/practice-parity.json
```

### Known divergences

`knownDivergences` records places a native surface deliberately answers
differently, with the reason. A key listed there is allowed to differ; anything
not listed is drift and should fail the native assertion. Removing an entry is
a decision, not cleanup.

The entry present at version 1 is `transposeMax`: the web clamps a song
transpose to ±12 semitones and iOS clamps it to ±24. That was found by writing
this contract. It has not been adjudicated, so it is recorded rather than
quietly changed on one side.

### Versioning

`version` is bumped only when the *shape* changes: a key added, removed or
renamed. A changed value is never a version bump. A value is the thing the
contract exists to surface, and the native side should meet it as a failing
assertion rather than as a version it is allowed to skip.
